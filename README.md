Here is the spec for the first step in their process:

Please create an empty Spring Boot project.

Add the following REST API endpoints

GET /tasks <- Returns all tasks
GET /tasks/:id <- Returns Task by ID

POST/tasks <- Creates a Task
PUT  /tasks/:id <- Updates a Task by ID

Task model should include:

title: String
description: String
completed: Boolean
createDate: Date
completed: Date


Store the task data in memory for retrieval and updates, no database required

Please commit the code to a git platform of your choice (github/gitlab/bitbucket/etc) and share the link with us.

Team will pull and run the code to test the API so ensure Readme include all details required to start the project.
